cbs-enable-speed=Enabled speed effect from beacons, and enables speed modules for [item=captive-biter-spawner] __ITEM__captive-biter-spawner__
cbs-enable-productivity=Enabled productivity effect from beacons, and enables productivity modules for [item=captive-biter-spawner] __ITEM__captive-biter-spawner__\nThis will also enable productivity on the biter-egg recipe, so if you're using any mods that add alternative ways to craft biter eggs, this will also be affected.
cbs-enable-quality=Enabled quality effect from beacons, and enables quality modules for [item=captive-biter-spawner] __ITEM__captive-biter-spawner__\nBeware that you cant have more than one quality type in the output, so if you don't remove biter eggs you might lose the next crafted batch, if it's not the same quality.
cbs-enable-pollution=Enabled pollution effect from beacons, and enables efficiency modules for [item=captive-biter-spawner] __ITEM__captive-biter-spawner__, but only the pollution effect.\nNote that this effect from efficiency modules will make the Captured Biter Spawner worse at absorbing pollution, since it has a negative pollution value.
cbs-enable-consumption=Enabled consumption effect from beacons, and enables efficiency modules for [item=captive-biter-spawner] __ITEM__captive-biter-spawner__, but only the consumption effect.
cbs-module-slots=The amount of modules slots to be added to the [item=captive-biter-spawner] __ITEM__captive-biter-spawner__.
